# solarsysgen

A solar system generator in html + vanilla js.
This solar system generator was partialy generated with copilot. I aimed to test generative IA capabilities.
Then the project became a way to create a real solar system generator in a way that we can use it for real purposes like :

- Creating a solar system for a role playing game
- Creating a solar system for a science fiction novel
- Creating a solar system for a science fiction movie
- Creating a solar system for a science fiction video game
- Creating a solar system for a science fiction board game

## Demo

You can try the current state of the project [here](https://revilofr.github.io/).

- Gas clouds in background are randomly generated. Partially done

## Roadmap

1. Suns can be of different types (red dwarf, yellow dwarf, blue giant, etc.). Partially done
2. Planets can be of different types (terrestrial, gas giant, ice giant, etc.). Partially done
3. Solar systems can be saved in a json file
4. Solar systems can be loaded from a json file
5. Can zoom in and out on the solar system
6. Can move the solar system in the viewport
